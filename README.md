# Plack::Debugger

This is a rethinking of the Plack::Middleware::Debug module 
to support a more modern and dynamic web, specifically AJAX
requests and more in depth profiling data which is not always
available during the normal request lifecycle.

# CAVEAT

This module is still heavily in development, many many many
things may change. You have been warned!
